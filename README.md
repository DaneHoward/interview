This was originally a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) that was converted into a personal project (that was disclosed in the interview).

I repurposed that project to fit the needs assigned to me (+/-). 

I hope you like it!

clone the repo -> navigate to that location via cmd -> run npm i -> run "npm run dev -- -p 3030" since the php backend will run on 3000, as requested.
